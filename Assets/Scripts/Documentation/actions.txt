You could interface with a tank via three objects - <color="blue">actions</color>, <color="blue">sensors</color> and <color="blue">stats</color>. If you assign anything else to theese identifiers, script engine of your tank would be broken and only restart would be able to save it.

Properties of <color="blue">actions</color> are assignable. All the properties of that object affect behaviour of tank in some way (see the picture with comments below).
