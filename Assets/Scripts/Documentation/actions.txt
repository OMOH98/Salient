You could interface with a tank via three objects - <color=navy>actions</color>, <color=navy>sensors</color> and <color=navy>stats</color>. If you assign anything else to theese identifiers, script engine of your tank would be broken.

<color=navy>actions</color> are assignable. All the properties of that object affect behaviour of tank in some way (see the picture with comments below).
