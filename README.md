## What is it?
It is a game written using Unity that fetures programming as the main mechanic. The goal of the player is to write Javascript code to govern tank robot in order to win battles with opponents. 
## How to install it?
Currently provided binaries support only windows platform. Download either self-unpacking or usual zip archive and unpack it. Create a shortcut for `Salient.exe` file optionally.
## How do I play it?
As said, the main goal is to create as good script as possible. However, at this point it is a non-trivial task: UI is not exactly user-friendly, in-game documentation is sketchy and API does not provide sufficient level of abstraction. For starters, examine commented code template (it is provided as an example) and two functioning code examples (simple and advanced turrets). Also. check quickstart section of documentation (you can bring it on using Show docs panel button in Code scene).
